# green-spot
An openCV project that scans areas for foliage.

We use thresholding to scan for foliage like grass lawns, forests and shrubbery over huge satellite images of land, and determine how much foliage exists in the given area.

We can use these given stats to

- Estimate areas where low trees are found and thus make it easier for authorities to start working on afforestation.
- Detect if any deforestation is being processed on large acres of land.
- Provide valuable stats for helping fight climate change.

## How to use

Specify your input file in given python script, and run it. The requirements are. OpenCV2, IMGutils and Numpy.
